# Snap Game Framework
Snap is a game framework written in C99 with OpenGL.

## Purpose
Snap was written, for the most part, with learning in mind. One of my previous projects called `aif-graphics` (it is a public repository on my account) is a graphics library written in C++ for a subject called AIF in Year 12, it was the product of a learning journey where **many** mistakes were made. It was in that project that I learnt how I function as a programmer, and through making mistakes, I learnt what to do and what not to do when making projects such as that one. It was this that guided my philosophy for this very simple game framework.

## Philosophy
Snap aims to be a simple and intuitive game framework. While working with C++ in `aif-graphics`, I encountered the language's inherent complexity and verbosity, which are expected given C++ is a superset of C. As a result, I decided that C++ would not be my language of choice for my next project. I chose C99, a daunting shift since I had limited experience with languages below C++. Initially, the transition was challenging due to quality-of-life features (or lack thereof) seen in C++. However, I soon adapted and found myself quite comfortable. Although my codebase might not meet industry standards and there are certainly improvements to be made, I thoroughly enjoyed working with C.

## Usage
If someone wishes to use this library, for some odd reason, they should look towards the `examples/` folder that contains a CMake build script and example code file for a top-down 2D scene with a camera. It uses open sourced assets.
